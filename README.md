# ðŸš‘ Hospital ChatOps Bot
HosBot is a lightweight automation tool designed for hospital IT teams to manage their server infrastructure directly from Slack.
The bot enables IT admins to perform critical operations â€” such as checking server status, restarting services, and applying updates â€” without needing to log into servers manually.

Using a simple slash command interface, hospital staff can ensure that vital systems (like patient record servers, telemedicine portals, etc.) stay up and running smoothly with faster response times.
